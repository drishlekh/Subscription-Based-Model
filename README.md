# Subscription-Based-Model

This project implements a User Subscription Management Service using FastAPI, Python, SQLAlchemy, and MySQL. It provides a RESTful API for managing user subscriptions to various plans, including user registration, authentication (JWT), plan management, and subscription lifecycle handling (creation, retrieval, updates, cancellation, and automatic expiration).

## Core Functionalities

*   **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and JWT-based login.
*   **Plan Management:** Define and retrieve subscription plans.
*   **Subscription Lifecycle:** Allow users to subscribe, view, update, and cancel their subscriptions.
*   **Automatic Expiration:** Background task to automatically expire subscriptions.
